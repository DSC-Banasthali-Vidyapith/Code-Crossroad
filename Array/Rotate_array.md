Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N, rotate it by D elements in the counter-clockwise direction. 

**Input:**  N = 5, D = 2  

            arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}

**Output:** 3 4 5 1 2

**Explanation:** 1 2 3 4 5  when rotated by 2 elements, it becomes 3 4 5 1 2.

**Input:**  N = 10, D = 3

            arr[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}

**Output:** 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6

**Explanation:** 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 when rotated by 3 elements, it becomes 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^7

1 <= D <= N

0 <= arr <= 10^5
