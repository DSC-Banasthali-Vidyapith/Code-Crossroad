You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

**Input:**  N = 4 a[] = {1,2,3,5}

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** Missing integer is 4

**Input:**  N = 6 a[] = {6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 7}

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** Missing integer is 5

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

-10^7 ≤ arr ≤ 10^7
