Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array and return it. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5..... (considering the increasing lexicographical order).

**Input:**  n = 5 arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}

**Output:** 2 1 4 3 5

**Input:**  n = 6 arr[] = {2,4,7,8,9,10}

**Output:** 4 2 8 7 10 9

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(N)

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

0 ≤ arr ≤ 10^7
