Given an array arr of size N, swap the Kth element from beginning with Kth element from end.

**Input:**  N = 8, K = 3

            arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

**Output:** 1 2 6 4 5 3 7 8

**Explanation:** Kth element from beginning is 3 and from end is 6.

**Input:**  N = 5, K = 2

            arr[] = {5, 3, 6, 1, 2}
            
**Output:** 5 1 6 3 2

**Explanation:** Kth element from beginning is 3 and from end is 1.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)

**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ arr ≤ 10^3
