Given an array arr of size N, swap the Kth element from beginning with Kth element from end.

**Input:**  N = 8, K = 3
            arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
**Output:** 1 2 6 4 5 3 7 8
**Explanation:** Kth element from beginning is 3 and from end is 6.

**Input:**  N = 5, K = 2
            arr[] = {5, 3, 6, 1, 2}
**Output:** 5 1 6 3 2
**Explanation:** Kth element from beginning is 3 and from end is 1.

**Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr ≤ 10^3
