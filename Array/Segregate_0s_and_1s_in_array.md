Given an array of length N consisting of only 0s and 1s in random order. Modify the array to segregate 0s on left side and 1s on the right side of the array.

Input:  N = 5 
        arr[] = {0, 0, 1, 1, 0}
Output: 0 0 0 1 1

Input:  N = 4
        arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 1 1 1 1

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ arr ≤ 1
